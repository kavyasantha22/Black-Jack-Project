# Blackjack Game in Python/Java üÉè

This is an object-oriented implementation of the classic **Blackjack** card game in two vesion, Python and Java. The project simulates a single-player game against a dealer, featuring game logic, betting mechanics, and statistics tracking. The code integrates user-friendly features, clear terminal UI, and data visualization for an engaging experience.
